I am Yanjun Liu (刘彦君), a roboticist at CUHK. Previously, I obtained my master's degree in artificial intelligence at Tsinghua SIGS under the supervision of Prof. Wenming Yang and my bachelor's degree in robotics at Northeastern University. My research interests include robotic control and human-robot interaction in surgical settings. You can contact me via email [lyj19990319@126.com](mailto:lyj19990319@126.com) or [yanjunliu@cuhk.edu.hk](mailto:yanjunliu@cuhk.edu.hk).
