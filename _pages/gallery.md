I am an aviation enthusiast (a.k.a. feiyou in Chinese) and we are an interest group specializing in all kinds of aviation stuff, such as plane spotting and flight simulation. Some useful links listed below can give you an introduction to our group:

As a flight simulator enthusiast, my first encounter with flight simulation software dates back to 2010 and ever since I have gained pretty much amateur (or professional? Just kidding :) ) experience on Microsoft Flight Simulator (X and 2020), AeroflyFS (iPad ver.) and Prepar3D. I especially love to steer Boeing passenger jets, such as PMDG 737/747/777, QualityWings/Aerofly 787.

As a plane spotter, I am a member of Dalian Aviation Photographer Group but currently I am available in Shenzhen, Guangzhou and Hong Kong. My shooting equippment is Nikon D500 with Nikkor AF-S 70-300mm and Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary. Over the past few years, I have also left great plane spotting memories in many cities and airports, including:
- Dalian Zhoushuizi Intl. Airport (DLC/ZYTL) [MY BASE]
- Shenzhen Baoan Intl. Airport (SZX/ZGSZ) [CURRENT CITY]
- Shenyang Taoxian Intl. Airport (SHE/ZYTX)
- Beijing Capital Intl. Airport (PEK/ZBAA)
- Hong Kong Intl. Airport (HKG/VHHH)
